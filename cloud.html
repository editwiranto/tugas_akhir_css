      <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the
        problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.

      <h1>Types of artificial intelligence—weak AI vs. strong AI</h1>
      <p>
        While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have
        surfaced over the last few decades, John McCarthy offers the following
        definition in this 2004 paper (PDF, 106 KB) (link resides outside
        IBM), " It is the science and engineering of making intelligent
        machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to
        the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence,
        but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are
        biologically observable."
      </p>
      <p>
        However, decades before this definition, the birth of the artificial
        intelligence conversation was denoted by Alan Turing's seminal work,
        "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (PDF, 89.8 KB)(link resides
        outside of IBM), which was published in 1950. In this paper, Turing,
        often referred to as the "father of computer science", asks the
        following question, "Can machines think?" From there, he offers a
        test, now famously known as the "Turing Test", where a human
        interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human
        text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since its
        publish, it remains an important part of the history of AI as well as
        an ongoing concept within philosophy as it utilizes ideas around
        linguistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig then proceeded to publish, Artificial
        Intelligence: A Modern Approach (link resides outside IBM), becoming
        one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve
        into four potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiates
        computer systems on the basis of rationality and thinking vs. acting:

      <h1>Deep learning vs. machine learning</h1>
      <p>
        Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used
        interchangeably, it’s worth noting the nuances between the two. As
        mentioned above, both deep learning and machine learning are
        sub-fields of artificial intelligence, and deep learning is actually a
        sub-field of machine learning.
      </p>
      <img src="img/perbedaan.jpg" alt="gambar-deep neural network" />
      <p>
        The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how
        each algorithm learns. Deep learning automates much of the feature
        extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human
        intervention required and enabling the use of larger data sets. You
        can think of deep learning as "scalable machine learning" as Lex
        Fridman noted in same MIT lecture from above. Classical, or
        "non-deep", machine learning is more dependent on human intervention
        to learn. Human experts determine the hierarchy of features to
        understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more
        structured data to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Deep" machine learning can leverage labeled datasets, also known as
        supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t
        necessarily require a labeled dataset. It can ingest unstructured data
        in its raw form (e.g. text, images), and it can automatically
        determine the hierarchy of features which distinguish different
        categories of data from one another. Unlike machine learning, it
        doesn't require human intervention to process data, allowing us to
        scale machine learning in more interesting ways.

      <h1>Artificial intelligence applications</h1>
      <p>
        There are numerous, real-world applications of AI systems today. Below
        are some of the most common examples:
      </p>
      <ol type="I">
        <li>
          <strong>Speech Recognition :</strong> It is also known as automatic
          speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or
          speech-to-text, and it is a capability which uses natural language
          processing (NLP) to process human speech into a written format. Many
          mobile devices incorporate speech recognition into their systems to
          conduct voice search—e.g. Siri—or provide more accessibility around
          texting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Customer Service :</strong> Online chatbots are replacing
          human agents along the customer journey. They answer frequently
          asked questions (FAQs) around topics, like shipping, or provide
          personalized advice, cross-selling products or suggesting sizes for
          users, changing the way we think about customer engagement across
          websites and social media platforms. Examples include messaging bots
          on e-commerce sites with virtual agents, messaging apps, such as
          Slack and Facebook Messenger, and tasks usually done by virtual
          assistants and voice assistants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Computer Vision : </strong> This AI technology enables
          computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital
          images, videos and other visual inputs, and based on those inputs,
          it can take action. This ability to provide recommendations
          distinguishes it from image recognition tasks. Powered by
          convolutional neural networks, computer vision has applications
          within photo tagging in social media, radiology imaging in
          healthcare, and self-driving cars within the automotive industry.
